   chmod 777 cache
   chmod 777 -R graphicals/lists
   chmod 777 graphicals/cache
   chmod 755 flashterm
4) Configure optional components (below)
5) (Optional) Add a nightly run of import/mirrors.php if you want to merge other webmudlists with yours
   mirror.php should be run about 1 hour before cron.php
6) Add a nightly run of cron.php with    php -f /path/to/file/cron.php
7) Visit folder in web browser

NOTE: You may wish to periodically make a manual backup of your lists/ directory content.
You could use this to create a delta T projection like they do at FindMUD.com

Optional Components
-------------------

--- Supporting ANSI MUD Banner translation to HTML

In the perl/ folder, as root, install all three perl add-ons in this order:

The other option is to render png files of MUDs using ansilove-php, (see below)
but I felt that alone was a bit cumbersome.  It also uses the GPL.

If you don't trust this source, the packages are available here:

http://search.cpan.org/~ajwood/Term-VT102-0.91/VT102.pm (prereq)
http://search.cpan.org/~rra/ANSIColor-3.00/ANSIColor.pm (prereq)
http://search.cpan.org/~nuffin/HTML-FromANSI-2.03/lib/HTML/FromANSI.pm

Download links are on the right hand side.

Use this command trio to install from each archive in the order the links appear above:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test             (optional)
make install

If you want to use ansilove-php, install into your webmudlister directory and
change the webmudlister config, also set ANSILOVE_FILES_DIRECTORY equal to ../cache
inside ansilove.cfg.php ; notice: this changes the license to GPL

--- Supporting the FlashTerm

To use the terminal features of the web mud lister, Flash has to have
a socket server running on a port on your local network.

Packaged with webmudlister is FlashTerm, from www.FlashTerm.com,
with original documentation intact.  The web mud lister dumps the 
flashterm/settings.xml, so changing that file leads nowhere. 

Settings for the FlashTerm are found in the config.inc.php or config.php file.
The port used for running flashpolicyd_v0.6 will have to match in config.php
to the one you use to run the policy server.

* You'll want to add this server to your cron boot tasks, so it runs as a daemon. *

To properly configure the Flash socket server with Web Mud Lister,
you're going to have to visit the socket server directory in flasterm/flashpolicyd_v0.6
and configure it according to the instructions found in README.txt

http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/articles/socket_policy_files.html

This insures that the target server has permission.  Adobe's sample code is
included (snarfed from the above link).  You can look at that in:

flashterm/flashpolicyd_v0.6

It's possible that MUDs who use the Flash Term could ban your service,
since it bounces through your service to reach the MUD.  C'est la vie.
