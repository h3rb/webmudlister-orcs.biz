
While ambling along, cramming a large chilli burger down your throat 
and reading a dubious magazine, you trip but somehow miss the ground. 
You are falling towards a large neon sign:

'VOID under construction. The management apologises for any reality failures.'

You are rescued, but your burger is incinerated as a public health hazard.

Registration Desk.
You are standing in front of the Void's registration desk, a large 
green demon sits here registering all newcomers. The demon hands you a 
registration form marked "All Ape Descended Lifeforms" and says "Fill it in".
