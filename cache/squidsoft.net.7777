-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu had spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First, contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

 You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

So, we had some downtime! As some of you noticed, we put up a website on a separate host so that we could keep you updated on our status. However, it seems that a lot of people never realized it existed, so let's fix that now.

MAIN WEBSITE: http://squidsoft.net - Kept updated with general news about Squidsoft.

FORUM: http://squidsoft.net/forum - An all-purpose forum!

IRC: #Squidsoft on gamesurge.net - I don't know about the other hosts, but I plan to keep idling in here, so it'll be a good place to keep in contact outside the game.

It seems like the subdomains are all playing nicely, but just so you don't encounter any problems in the future, you should make sure that your connection information for SC uses the host MOO.SQUIDSOFT.NET.
