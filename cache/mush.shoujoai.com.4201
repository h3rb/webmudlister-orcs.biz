This MUSH may contain themes not suitable to minors. As such, we require that
only those that of 18 years or older may enter for legal reasons. By entering,
you are stating that you are at least of 18 years of age, and that Shoujo-Ai 
MUSH will not be held responsible for anything that you may encounter.

TO NEW PLAYERS: If you're having trouble registering, ensure the name you want
is not currently in use by typing "connect guest" and then "finger <name>" to
check whether it already exists. Also make sure you omit the <> characters;
these are simply there to indicate where to insert the appropriate information.

We strongly recommend against using an email account through AOL or Hotmail,
as both have issues delivering mail sent from us, if they deliver it at all.
Signing up with GMail or another free email service is recommended instead.
