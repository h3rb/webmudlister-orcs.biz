 Tapestries MUCK is a cross between a real life BDSM play party, a free form
 roleplaying environment, and a social gathering place all within a furry
 theme. It strives to provide a place for safe and free exploration of
 dominance and submission roleplay, as well as other forms of sexual
 expression in public and in private. Tapestries facilitates this by providing
 an environment that is populated exclusively by adult players and furry
 characters, as well as by setting guidelines that encourage tolerance and
 respect of other's fantasies and beliefs.
