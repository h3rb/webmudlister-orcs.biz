"In the world I see -- you're stalking elk through the damp canyon
forests around the ruins of Rockefeller Center.  You will wear leather
clothes that last you the rest of your life.  You will climb the
wrist-thick kudzu vines that wrap the Sears Tower.  You will see tiny
figures pounding corn and laying strips of venison on the empty car
pool lane of the ruins of a superhighway."
