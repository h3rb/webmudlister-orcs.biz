Welcome to YorMUX
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  YorMUX chronicles the world of Yor, which starts out as a simple, small
  area where the players are deposited. It is a cross-dimensional world
  where characters from different media(or of the player's creation) can meet
  and interact, as well as to help build a place to live and explore the
  world's quirks.

  This is primarily a community-driven effort, but conflict between characters
  is inevitable. This is also an Adults-only game due to mature themes, and
  no players under 18(or 21 in some areas) will be allowed. If you would like
  to participate, please login and take a look around. We are still small but 
  growing quickly, and more quality roleplayers are welcome.

  "connect <name> <password>" connects you to an existing character.
  "connect guest" connects you to a guest account if one is prepared.
  "create <name> <password>" creates a new character.

  "WHO" tells you who is logged in to the game (case sensitive).
  "QUIT" exits the game and saves your character.

  Once logged on, "help" gives help on specific commands, functions, and
  special topics.  Other 'help' commands include "+help" and "news".

  To see if a name is free, log on as Guest and try "+alias <name>"
