            We turn our frightened faces to each other, say goodbye            
                  Waited for the sign, waited for the moment                   
              Waited for the miracle to arrive, I guess they lied              
                                                                               
             Look at your future, take a look at your burning sky              
                Look at your future, look at your burning sky"
