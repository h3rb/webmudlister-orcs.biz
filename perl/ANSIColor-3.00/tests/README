The files in this directory were written by Joe Smith to test terminals
for support of various VT100 escape sequences.  ansicolor is of the most
interest in developing this package, but vt100-torture also tests some of
the other attributes this module supports.

To use one of these files, you should be able to display it in your
terminal with cat.  These tests may be useful in expanding the table of
supported terminal emulators in the Term::ANSIColor documentation.
