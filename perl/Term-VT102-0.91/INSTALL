To install Term::VT102, simply unpack the distribution archive (something
like "tar xzvf Term-VT102-x.y.tar.gz" should do it), enter the top-level
directory, and do:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test           (this step is optional)
  make install

You should then be able to use the Term::VT102 module in your Perl scripts.
See the README file for an introduction and do "perldoc Term::VT102" for API
details.
