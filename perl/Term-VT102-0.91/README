This is the README file for Term::VT102, a Perl module which provides
emulation of a VT102 terminal.

Like the "expect" Tcl extension, this module is intended primarily for use
as a way of automating processes; for instance, you can write a script which
connects via telnet to a full-screen service of some kind (such as a router,
or a telephone switch), uses this module to parse the output, and therefore
can tell what is currently "on the screen" and react accordingly.  "Expect"
cannot really do this, as it is stream-oriented, rather than being able to
tell you, say, what's on the top row of the screen.

For installation instructions, see the INSTALL file.
